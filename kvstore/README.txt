Run the start_stuff.bat file (.\src\start_stuff.bat)

Three terminals should open and start passing messages to each node.

In any of these terminals, paste in a command

example:

write test 123
read test

Since the cmd keeps ticking, writing it on notepad and then pasting it in and then hitting enter is recommended.
